"""Find out which supplier a file is from, and extract its prices.

The file name is NOT trusted: files arrive as 'WhatsApp Image ...jpeg', with typos ('Westaflia'),
or even named after the wrong supplier. The content decides:
  1. identifiers in the text (web domain, e-mail, company name, Chamber of Commerce number...):
     each supplier's `match_text`. If found, the supplier is certain.
  2. otherwise the layout: every supplier that reads this kind of file tries it, and the one that
     reads the most real products wins (`layout_hints` in each supplier add to its score).
  3. the file name only helps to choose between equally good candidates, and typos are tolerated.
If the name and the content disagree, the content wins and the report says so.
